# Cursor Rules for SmartCollectionView Project

## Future Enhancements
- Always check `FUTURE_TODOS.md` before implementing new features or making architectural decisions
- Future work items include: view recycling, off-screen unmounting, maxHeight optimization, localData strategy review, and layout enhancements (vertical list, horizontal/vertical grids, custom layouts)
- When adding new features, evaluate if they align with items in FUTURE_TODOS.md

## Layout Architecture
- Current implementation is **horizontal list/grid only**
- Layout calculations are hardcoded for horizontal scrolling in `performFullLayoutRecompute`
- When expanding to other layouts (vertical list, grids), refactor layout logic into layout providers or a switch statement based on layout type
- Keep layout-specific calculations isolated and easily swappable

## Code Style
- Use `SCVLog`, `SCVShadowLog`, `SCVManagerLog` macros for debugging (filterable by module)
- All layout calculations should log frames, sizes, and directions for debugging
- Shadow view and native view prop synchronization is handled via `syncPropsToShadowView`

## React Native Version
- Target: React Native 0.72.3 (legacy architecture)
- iOS only for POC
- Uses shadow node interception pattern for virtualization

## Git Workflow
- Always create a new git branch when starting work on a new feature or capability
- Branch naming: `feature/description` for features, `fix/description` for bugs, `refactor/description` for refactoring
- Example: `fix/child-rendering-shadow-to-native-bridge`, `refactor/height-property-setter`
